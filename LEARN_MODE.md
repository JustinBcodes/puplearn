# üß† Learn Mode - Adaptive Learning Algorithm

Learn Mode is an intelligent, Quizlet-inspired study mode that uses adaptive algorithms to help users master flashcards efficiently through spaced repetition and dynamic prioritization.

## Overview

Learn Mode differs from standard flashcard review by:
- **Requiring typed answers** instead of passive flipping
- **Tracking mastery** for each card individually
- **Adapting dynamically** based on user performance
- **Using spaced repetition** to optimize retention
- **Persisting progress** so users can resume sessions

## Algorithm Details

### Card State Tracking

Each flashcard maintains the following state during a learn session:

```typescript
{
  correctStreak: number;      // Consecutive correct answers
  totalCorrect: number;       // Total correct attempts
  totalIncorrect: number;     // Total incorrect attempts
  mastered: boolean;          // Has reached mastery goal
  lastSeen: Date | null;      // Last time shown
  priority: number;           // Selection weight (higher = more likely)
}
```

### Adaptive Scheduling

The algorithm uses **weighted random selection** to choose the next card:

1. **Priority Calculation**
   - Base priority: `100`
   - **+50** for each incorrect answer (emphasize weak cards)
   - **-20** for each consecutive correct answer (de-emphasize strong cards)
   - **-10** for each total correct (reduce frequency)
   - **√ó0.3** if seen within last 2 minutes (short-term spacing)

2. **Card Selection**
   - Only unmastered cards are eligible
   - Cards with higher priority have higher selection probability
   - Weighted random ensures variety while prioritizing weak cards

3. **Mastery Rules**
   - Default mastery goal: **2 consecutive correct answers**
   - Incorrect answer **resets the streak** to 0
   - Session completes when **all cards are mastered**

### Answer Checking

Answers are normalized before comparison:
- Convert to lowercase
- Trim whitespace
- Remove punctuation
- This allows flexible matching (e.g., "photosynthesis" = "Photosynthesis!")

## User Flow

### 1. Starting Learn Mode

From a study set page, click **"üß† Learn Mode"**:

```
Study Set Page
  ‚Üì
Click "Learn Mode"
  ‚Üì
Create/Resume Learn Session
  ‚Üì
Initialize progress for all cards
```

### 2. Answering Cards

```
[Show Question]
  ‚Üì
User types answer
  ‚Üì
Submit ‚Üí Check correctness
  ‚Üì
[Show Feedback]
  ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ Correct ‚Üí Update streak, reduce priority
  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚ùå Wrong ‚Üí Reset streak, increase priority
  ‚Üì
Continue ‚Üí Select next card (weighted random)
```

### 3. Progress Tracking

Real-time progress bar shows:
- **X of Y mastered** (e.g., "5 of 20 mastered")
- **Percentage completion** (e.g., "25%")

Individual card indicators:
- **üü° Needs practice** - Has incorrect attempts
- **üü¢ Streak: X** - Current consecutive correct count

### 4. Session Completion

When all cards are mastered:
```
[Completion Screen]
  - Total cards mastered
  - Overall accuracy percentage
  - Total attempts
  - Motivational corgi message
  
Options:
  - üîÑ Learn Again (restart with new session)
  - üìö Back to Set
```

## Database Schema

### LearnSession
Tracks an individual learning session for a study set:

```prisma
model LearnSession {
  id            String          @id @default(cuid())
  userId        String
  studySetId    String
  isCompleted   Boolean         @default(false)
  masteryGoal   Int             @default(2)
  createdAt     DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime        @updatedAt
  learnProgress LearnProgress[]
}
```

### LearnProgress
Tracks progress for each flashcard in a session:

```prisma
model LearnProgress {
  id              String       @id @default(cuid())
  sessionId       String
  flashcardId     String
  correctStreak   Int          @default(0)
  totalCorrect    Int          @default(0)
  totalIncorrect  Int          @default(0)
  mastered        Boolean      @default(false)
  lastSeen        DateTime?
  priority        Int          @default(100)
  createdAt       DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime     @updatedAt

  @@unique([sessionId, flashcardId])
}
```

  selectNextCard(cards: LearnCard[]): LearnCard | null

  // Calculate selection weight based on progress
  calculateWeight(progress: CardProgress): number

  // Update progress after user answers
  updateProgress(progress: CardProgress, isCorrect: boolean): CardProgress

  // Calculate overall session progress
  calculateProgress(cards: LearnCard[]): ProgressStats

  // Check if session is complete
  isSessionComplete(cards: LearnCard[]): boolean

  // Normalize and compare answers
  checkAnswer(userAnswer: string, correctAnswer: string): boolean
}
```

### React Components
